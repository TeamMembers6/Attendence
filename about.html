    <h1>Attendance</h1>
    <p>Attendance in colleges is crucial for academic success, often requiring students to meet a minimum percentage to qualify for exams. Students facing attendance shortages typically submit applications to their college principal, explaining their circumstances, such as illness or personal issues. These applications often include details like the duration of absence and supporting documents, such as medical certificates, to justify their request for leniency. Colleges may have specific policies regarding attendance, allowing for condonation under certain conditions, emphasizing the importance of maintaining regular attendance for academic performance.</p>
